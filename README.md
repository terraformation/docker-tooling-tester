## Who maintains this image?
## How do I contribute to this image?

Contributions are very welcome! Check out the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/terraformation/docker-tooling-tester/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions.

## How is this Module versioned?

This image follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release, 
along with the changelog, in the [Releases Page](../../releases). 

During initial development, the major version will be 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a 
stable API. Once we hit `1.0.0`, we will make every effort to maintain a backwards compatible API and use the MAJOR, 
MINOR, and PATCH versions on each release to indicate any incompatibilities. 

You will find a synthesis of each published version in the [changelog](https://github.com/terraformation/docker-tooling-tester/tree/master/CHANGELOG.md) file.
